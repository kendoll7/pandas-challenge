Module 4 Challenge

Analysis.
The analysis shows which schools having the highest percentage of students successful in reading and math scores. We create dataframes that show the budgests and success of students in the schools. We then looked at specific facets of the schools. We can see the contrasts in sizing of the schools and if they are district or charter and their budgets.

Surprisingly, we see schools with lower spending ranges correlating to higher percentages of passing reading and math.
We also see a significant difference in the overall success of Charter schools (90% passing) than District schools (54% passing).
